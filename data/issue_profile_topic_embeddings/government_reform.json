[{"bioguideId":"C001136","summary":"Introduced the VA DATA Act of 2025 to prohibit the administrator of DOGE from accessing individual veterans' data held by the Department of Veterans Affairs and to establish restrictions and requirements for special government employees' access to VA data, including limits on use, return of data upon completion of service, and prohibitions on retaining copies for non-governmental or commercial purposes. Also supported codifying and strengthening a federal multi-agency task force to improve coordination, information sharing, and enforcement against illicit e-cigarette imports and sales. Introduced the Funding Small Businesses During Shutdowns Act to keep critical SBA programs operating during a government shutdown by providing specific short-term appropriations to continue loans and administrative operations. Introduced the Hatch Enforcement Act to ensure the U.S. Office of Special Counsel can continue enforcing the Hatch Act during federal government shutdowns, responding to alleged repeated partisan violations by the Trump administration and instances where agencies (including CDC, DOJ, FDA, SBA, OMB, HUD, and the official White House website) used public platforms for partisan messages; the bill aims to maintain accountability and investigations even when other operations are suspended. Also led a bicameral letter with 137 colleagues to the Acting Secretary of Labor raising urgent oversight questions about reports that Elon Musk and DOGE have been granted access to Department of Labor internal systems and data, demanding transparency on data access, confidentiality, security, regulatory oversight, and personnel protections and seeking answers by March 7, 2025. Co-led a July 29, 2025 letter with Rep. Herb Conaway Jr. and other Members calling for transparency and written responses from Defense and DHS leadership regarding plans to house undocumented immigrants at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, requesting briefings and detailed information by August 15, 2025 on timeline, facility construction, funding/reimbursement, detainee qualifications and care, and coordination with local authorities to ensure mission readiness is not compromised. Newly appointed to the House Armed Services Committee, he will now participate directly in NDAA negotiations and congressional oversight of the Department of Defense, bringing additional capacity to conduct hearings and investigations into defense policy, spending, readiness, and personnel issues. Recently appointed to the House Veterans' Affairs and House Small Business Committees as well, positions he says will expand his oversight role on veterans' benefits, care, and small business policy and allow him to advance district priorities more directly. He also voted against the DHS funding bill, arguing DHS should not receive additional funds until it takes \"serious and significant steps\" to rein in abusive ICE agents and allows Congress to

addressed concerns about judicial activism at town halls, criticizing judicial overreach and signaling opposition to judicial activism. He also emphasized constituent casework and helping residents navigate federal agencies during the town hall meetings. In June 2025 he introduced legislation to repeal the statutory authority for OCED and described the move as 'draining the swamp' and restoring accountability by shutting down an ineffective federal office. In September 2025 he introduced and secured House passage (225-203) of the DC Juvenile Sentencing Reform Act, characterizing it as a necessary congressional intervention into D.C. governance to reverse local 'pro-crime' policies and expand federal prosecutorial reach by allowing more juveniles to be transferred to adult felony court for violent offenses. In February 2026 he used a disapproval resolution under the Home Rule Act (H.J.Res.142) to block the D.C. Council's temporary tax law that would decouple the District from key provisions of the Working Families Tax Cut Act, asserting congressional oversight to preserve federal tax relief for D.C. residents. In November 2025 he filed new articles of impeachment against Chief Judge James E. Boasberg accusing the judge of abusing judicial authority, weaponizing the courts against conservative Members of Congress and organizations, and facilitating the Arctic Frost project that allegedly enabled DOJ surveillance of Republican senators; Gill framed the impeachment as necessary to hold the judiciary accountable and to confront what he describes as politicized judges. In November 2025 he reiterated his March 18, 2025 impeachment filing against Boasberg for blocking President Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, which Gill says usurped executive authority. In September 2025 he introduced the Domestic Jobs Protection Act to strip DHS of the discretionary authority to issue Employment Authorization Documents to unauthorized immigrants (targeting the statutory discretion in 8 U.S.C. §1324a(h)(3)(B)), framing the bill as reclaiming Congress's constitutional authority over immigration and preventing future administrations from using executive discretion to alter immigration and work-authorization policy. The Domestic Jobs Protection Act received support from hardline immigration groups such as the Immigration Accountability Project, Federation for American Immigration Reform, and the Bull Moose Project and was cosponsored by several conservative House members. In February 2026 he led RSC members in pressing the Senate Rules Committee to schedule a markup for the SAVE Act, publicly criticizing Senate leaders for blocking committee action, urging the Senate to move the election-integrity bill to the floor before the midterms, and attacking perceived Senate inaction and filibuster-related excuses as impediments to delivering legislative results. In March 2025 he also introduced legislation directing the U.S. Postal Service to assign a single, unique ZIP code to Northlake, Texas to reduce mail and boundary confusion, clarify municipal borders, protect local sales tax revenue, and resolve constituent-level administrative issues. He was also selected to serve on the House Oversight D.O.G.E. (Delivering on Government Efficiency) Subcommittee, where he pledged to use oversight to 'drain the swamp,' slash 'woke, weaponized government waste,' and make federal government operations more efficient, transparent, and accountable. He further sponsored the Foreign Influence Transparency and Accountability Act in May 2025, advancing accountability tools—mandatory audits of universities, cumulative excise taxes for funds from countries of concern, and steep penalties for unreported foreign gifts—to enforce existing Higher Education Act reporting requirements and hold institutions of higher education to stricter transparency standards. In an October 1, 2025 statement he blamed Senate Democrats for the fiscal-appropriations funding lapse, saying House Republicans had passed a bipartisan continuing resolution and accusing Democrats of holding the government hostage; he emphasized his district offices would remain open to serve constituents during the lapse. Upon his January 3, 2025 swearing-in for the 119th Congress Gill announced he had been elected Freshman Class President and noted his committee assignments on the House Judiciary, Budget, and Oversight committees—positions he is using to advance oversight, regulatory and judicial priorities. In February 2025 he introduced a bill to abolish the Fogarty International Center, labeling it duplicative of other NIH functions, 'woke,' and an unnecessary use of taxpayer dollars; he framed its

colleagues in formally requesting a congressional investigation into DHS for obstructing congressional oversight, lack of transparency, and inconsistent public statements; seeks accountability and clearer oversight mechanisms. Has pushed for legislative transparency and accountability in high-profile criminal matters, supporting the Epstein Files Transparency Act and use of discharge petitions to overcome leadership obstruction and force release of records to the public and survivors. Has supported withholding or voting against continued DHS funding in protest of leadership actions and has joined calls for Secretary-level accountability, including demands for resignation or impeachment where warranted. Most recently demanded clear answers and accountability after an ICE raid in Tucson in which she and her staff say they were pepper-sprayed while identifying as congressional staff, and condemned aggressive immigration enforcement actions on the House Floor. Introduced the No Delay in Representation Act to require that winners of special elections be offered the opportunity to be sworn in and seated within five legislative days after certification, a procedural reform intended to prevent Speakers or others from withholding the oath and depriving communities of representation and constituent services (citing her own 50-day delay that stalled House action on a discharge petition). Additionally called out a federally-controlled probe into the killing of Renee Nicole Good for excluding state and local authorities, demanded transparency and accountability, and urged Congress to halt funding for immigration enforcement until significant reforms are enacted; even called for impeachment of Secretary Noem for her handling of the incident. Has also emphasized the constitutional requirement that Congress authorize the use of military force and has criticized unilateral executive military actions as further evidence of the need to strengthen congressional oversight and constrain executive overreach. She also decried the insertion of the Oak Flat land-transfer as a midnight rider in the FY15 NDAA, calling it a backroom deal that denigrated the legislative process, lacked transparency and tribal consultation, and has introduced the Save Oak Flat from Foreign Mining Act to reverse that action. Most recently voted against a House DHS appropriations package, arguing the bill both dramatically increases ICE funding and weakens oversight by eliminating key oversight offices (e.g., Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, Immigration Detention Ombudsman, Family Reunification Task Force) and failing to require basic safeguards such as agent identification, mask bans, or limits on firearms in civil immigration enforcement. She has called for rescinding large ICE funding allocations and for stronger congressional controls over DHS spending and practices. Following a recent fatal shooting by an ICE agent in Minneapolis she called for Congress to assert its constitutional responsibility by fully investigating the incident, holding hearings, and reining in what she described as a lawless agency. After the Department of Justice released only a partial batch of the Epstein files despite the Epstein Files Transparency Act, she publicly condemned the administration for defying Congress, called the partial release an unlawful and unacceptable delay, and demanded that the Attorney General provide a timeline, explanation, and full compliance with the law. Upon being sworn in after a 50-day delay that left over 800,000 Arizonans without representation she called the obstruction an abuse of power and immediately signed multiple discharge petitions

bipartisan legislation (Muhammad Ali American Boxing Revival Act, H.R.4624) to clarify and update federal oversight of professional boxing — preserving the Ali Act, resolving legal ambiguity, and creating a framework for Unified Boxing Organizations (UBOs). Additionally, as a member of the House Rules Committee he advanced and supported H.R.1 via budget reconciliation, emphasizing elimination of waste/fraud in government programs, participating in a marathon Rules Committee hearing, and using reconciliation procedures to enact major priorities not subject to the Senate filibuster. In February 2025 he was appointed to the Delivering on Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) Subcommittee of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and pledged to work with the Department of Government Efficiency to identify and reduce government waste, streamline operations, and participate in oversight hearings such as 'The War on Waste' addressing improper payments and fraud. In January 2025 he was also appointed by Speaker Mike Johnson to the House Committee on Rules, reinforcing his role in the procedural management of legislation and the Speaker's control of the House Floor. He also supported the bipartisan Laken Riley Act (H.R.29), which includes provisions to give states standing to bring civil actions against federal officials who refuse to enforce immigration law, reflecting a willingness to change federal-state enforcement dynamics and increase accountability of federal enforcement actions. Recently used the Congressional Review Act to repeal a Biden Administration regulation affecting specific manufactured goods in his district (non-condensing tankless water heaters), led the bipartisan passage of H.J. Res. 20 in the House and saw it pass the Senate as well, welcomed Secretary of Energy Chris Wright to the Rinnai plant to celebrate the repeal, toured the assembly line, and spoke to workers and community leaders in a district event—demonstrating active procedural leadership and frequent committee/floor engagement to overturn executive rules deemed harmful to constituents. Has also hosted and leveraged visits from Cabinet members (e.g., Secretary of Education) and convened intergovernmental roundtables to highlight local program models and advance federal-state coordination on education and workforce initiatives. Continues to coordinate with the White House and Cabinet (including EPA and SBA visits) to pursue deregulation and targeted regulatory relief for district employers, using high-profile visits to press for administrative changes that he says protect local jobs. Serves as Chairman of the Small Business Subcommittee on Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Workforce Development and recently convened a bipartisan hearing titled 'Beyond the Ballpark' examining the economic impact of Minor League Baseball, noting that he is one of only five freshmen to chair a subcommittee in the 119th Congress. The Muhammad Ali American Boxing Revival Act (H.R.4624) also gained endorsements from five major arena operators and further clarifies federal oversight while encouraging alternative regulatory models (UBOs) to spur more U.S.-based boxing events, protect athletes, and incentivize innovation in the sport.
