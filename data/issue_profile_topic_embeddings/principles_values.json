[{"bioguideId":"C001136","summary":"Emphasized remembrance, unity, resilience, and the duty to honor and support those affected by the 9/11 attacks. Also condemned violent extremism, called for rejecting antisemitism and all forms of hate, and urged humanitarian action and pursuit of a peaceful, two-state resolution to conflict. Additionally highlighted the importance of protecting veterans' privacy and standing against corporate and unelected administrative overreach into veterans' benefits and data. Supported enforcement of existing laws to protect public health, uphold lawful markets, and prevent youth nicotine addiction from illegal vaping products. Criticized Republican-driven shutdown risks and prioritized ensuring uninterrupted support for small businesses and communities, while expressing willingness to negotiate to avoid shutdowns and lower health care costs. Further emphasized the principle of an impartial, apolitical federal government and introduced the Hatch Enforcement Act to keep Hatch Act enforcement and accountability operational during shutdowns, opposing the weaponization of government platforms for partisan political propaganda. Also stressed the importance of making government-supported innovation tools transparent, accessible, and inclusive by improving SBIR/STTR award data, highlighting Minority Serving Institutions, and promoting diverse partnerships. Recently led a bicameral effort pressing the Department of Labor for transparency and accountability over reports that Elon Musk and DOGE were granted access to Labor internal systems, framing private access to sensitive public-sector data as a threat to the public interest and calling for safeguards and answers. Condemned the use of the military as a domestic political tool in detaining undocumented immigrants at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst as unacceptable and shameful, and urged colleagues to oppose the action and seek its reversal. Condemned committee votes to reject amendments protecting veterans' access to Medicaid and SNAP and framed those votes as evidence that some majority members are unwilling to protect resources veterans have earned. Accepted appointment to the House Armed Services Committee and emphasized he will work in a bipartisan manner on defense and military readiness issues, stressing support for service members and the Joint Base McGuire–Dix–Lakehurst community as core commitments. He also announced appointments to the House Veterans' Affairs and Small Business Committees and framed those roles as further opportunities to advance district priorities on veterans' care and local economic development. At his February 2025 Burlington County Library town hall, he reiterated the importance of being \"tethered to your values\" during difficult times, pledged to remain bipartisan when achievable, encouraged constituent activism (letters, organizing, visiting Washington), and committed to holding monthly town halls to keep constituents engaged and accountable. In January 2026 he framed his vote against the DHS funding bill as an act consistent with these principles: refusing to fund a department that permits civil-rights abuses by ICE and demanding stronger congressional oversight and accountability before approving additional resources. On January 20, 2025 he publicly criticized President Trump's inaugural address as offering a divisive, \"dystopian\" vision of America, said it failed to inspire hope, and both reiterated his desire to work in a bipartisan fashion where possible and vowed to \"fight back\" against any Administration or Congressional Republican attempts to take away people's rights. In a March 4, 2025 statement responding to the President's joint address, he strongly denounced the speech as filled with falsehoods and divisive rhetoric, accused the President and his allies of creating a false reality, called out the influence of an \"unelected billionaire,\" vowed to continue pushing back against the Administration, and urged Republican colleagues to confront the President, return to shared principles, pursue unity, strengthen alliances, and work to support middle-class families and a brighter future for children. On February 4, 2025 he joined five other Democratic physician-members of the House in a public statement opposing the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to be HHS Secretary, framing the opposition as a defense of science- and evidence-based public health leadership and arguing that nominees who promote vaccine misinformation or undermine reproductive and mental health services should not lead HHS. On March 14, 2025 he also joined all six Democratic physician-Members in launching the Congressional Doctors Caucus to organize around defending science, evidence-based medicine, public-health institutions, medical research, patient-centered care, and to push back against misinformation and partisan attacks that threaten public health and access to care. Upon being sworn in to the U.S. House, he emphasized a commitment to \"defend democracy,\" to \"protect reproductive rights,\" and to \"put people over politics,\" reaffirming these principles as core commitments guiding his service.

attacks the Biden administration and Democrats for undoing Trump-era policies and creating 'mass chaos,' praises President Trump's policies, and positions himself as advancing Trump's agenda (introducing legislation to codify Trump's Remain in Mexico policy). He uses strong partisan rhetoric framing Democrats as prioritizing illegal immigrants over citizens and presents border security as a core Republican mandate. He also emphasizes promoting military and public service by nominating qualified young people to the nation's service academies and convening a board of former military and community leaders to advise selections. In March 2025 he publicly lauded President Trump as 'the greatest president of my lifetime,' celebrated Trump's Joint Address, and framed the period as the start of an 'America's Golden Age' under Trump while blaming the 'last four years' of Democrat governance for prior damage. In June 2025 he framed abolishing OCED and opposing the 'globalist climate agenda' as part of draining the swamp, restoring accountability, and promoting American energy freedom. In February 2026 he argued that 'mass Somali immigration makes the United States weaker, poorer and erodes social trust,' framing immigration control as an expression of national sovereignty and a policy that should prioritize citizens' interests. In November 2025 he used pointed rhetoric blaming Democrat leaders for allowing 'illegal aliens to get away with unspeakable crimes' and emphasized empowering law enforcement to remove dangerous foreign nationals quickly. In March 2025 he also led a partisan push to defund NPR and PBS, calling publicly funded broadcasters 'left-wing propaganda' and urging Congress to end federal support for media organizations he says attack President Trump and his supporters. In January 2026 he publicly accused Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and other Democrats of turning a blind eye or covering up Somali welfare fraud to protect a political voter base while praising DOJ oversight and prosecutions. In April 2025 he applauded President Trump's 'first 100 days,' called Trump 'the greatest president of my lifetime,' and urged Congress to codify Trump's executive orders into permanent law. On March 18, 2025 he filed articles of impeachment against Chief Judge James E. Boasberg, denouncing the judge as a 'radical activist' who 'tramples on the Constitution' and accusing the judiciary of illegally blocking the President's authority to remove dangerous foreign nationals; on November 4, 2025 he again filed impeachment articles accusing Boasberg of weaponizing the judiciary and facilitating the Arctic Frost project that allegedly enabled DOJ surveillance of Republican senators. These actions reinforce his combative, partisan approach to defending Trump-era policies and challenging institutions he views as obstructive. On October 8, 2025 he introduced the Expedited Removal of Criminal Aliens Act and framed it as part of President Trump's border security strategy, using rhetoric that accused Democrats of inviting gang members, terrorists, and violent offenders to 'invade our country en masse' and stressing that swift removal of violent criminal aliens is a matter of protecting American communities—language that underscores his combative, security-first, America First orientation. He also framed the March 2025 LAND Act as a patriotic, America First measure to block China and Iran from owning U.S. farmland, arguing reciprocity and protection of food production are core national-priority values. In June 2025 he introduced the Mobilizing Against Sanctuary Cities Act and framed cutting federal funds to noncompliant jurisdictions as a law-and-order, taxpayer-protection measure that aligns with

transparency, accountability, protection of constitutional duties, and the public's trust; framed DHS actions as undermining oversight, press freedoms, and democratic norms. Also emphasized defending every child's right to read, opposing censorship and book bans, and promoting equal educational opportunity through access to libraries and diverse materials. Additionally champions environmental stewardship, protection of public lands, and respect for tribal sovereignty, alongside defending workers' rights and community protections. Has introduced and co-sponsored a bipartisan resolution recognizing National Native American Heritage Month, reaffirming commitment to Tribal sovereignty, self-governance, the nation-to-nation relationship, protecting Native languages, and requiring meaningful consultation and tribal self-determination in federal policy. Recently underscored that transparency and release of government records in the Jeffrey Epstein matter are matters of human rights and justice for survivors, framing sunlight and accountability as core democratic values and criticizing efforts to block or delay oversight. Has also criticized what she describes as fearmongering, militarization, and authoritarian tendencies in immigration policy and federal leadership, calling for resignation or impeachment of officials when their actions endanger communities or violate democratic norms. In response to a recent ICE raid in Tucson where she reports being pepper-sprayed, reiterated the mantra \"No transparency, no accountability,\" committing to pursue answers and accountability for tactics that terrorize communities and undermine due process. Introduced the No Delay in Representation Act to protect voters and ensure newly elected representatives from special elections are sworn in promptly so that communities are not silenced by political gamesmanship. Reaffirmed the principles of the U.S. Constitution, including separation of powers and the rule of law, in a formal statement co-sponsored on the House floor. Celebrated a $622,637 federal grant to the Tohono O’odham Kiki Housing Authority to expand rental assistance for Native American veterans and highlighted the need to address generations of historic disinvestment in tribal communities by advocating for sustained federal resources. Most recently publicly condemned a Border Patrol raid of a humanitarian aid site, invoking the Fourth Amendment and due process and declaring that criminalizing humanitarian aid contradicts core constitutional and human-rights principles. In a Minneapolis field hearing she likewise demanded transparency and accountability in the aftermath of the killing of Renee Nicole Good, asserted that federal law enforcement must serve the people rather than terrorize them, and called for halting funding to immigration enforcement until reforms are made. She also voted against a House DHS appropriations package, saying it expands ICE funding while weakening oversight and thereby fails to protect the public from abuses by federal agencies; she urged the Senate to reject the bill and called for dismantling ICE as part of protecting democratic values and community safety. Following a recent fatal shooting by an ICE agent in Minneapolis she emphasized that ICE's actions make communities \"less safe, not more,\" reiterated calls for justice and congressional investigation, and urged Congress to reassert its oversight responsibilities. She also condemned the DOJ's partial release of the Epstein files as an affront to survivors and an example of the administration defying congressional law, demanding a clear timeline and explanation from the Attorney General and full compliance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act. Her swearing-in as the first Latina to represent Arizona and her emphasis that 813,000 Arizonans were left without representation for 50 days further underscore her stated commitments to

a bipartisan, athlete-focused approach by co-sponsoring H.R.4624 with a member of the other party, emphasizing fairness, safety, and opportunity for athletes. Also aligns with and has publicly supported President Trump’s Republican agenda (H.R.1), signaling strong party-aligned priorities on taxes, border security, and reducing government waste; publicly framed the vote as supporting the President's signature promises and historic tax relief. In February 2025 he emphasized holding the federal government accountable and was appointed to the D.O.G.E. Subcommittee, reinforcing a stated commitment to eliminate wasteful spending, optimize federal operations, and advance the 'America First' agenda through oversight. In January 2025 he was appointed by Speaker Mike Johnson to the House Committee on Rules and stated he is committed to work with colleagues to advance legislation that benefits Georgia's 3rd Congressional District, underscoring constituent-focused service and cooperation with House leadership. He also promoted the bipartisan Laken Riley Act as the first bill he co-sponsored in Congress, framing its passage as delivering justice for a murder victim and reflecting a commitment to law-and-order and public safety. Additionally, he delivered his first House Floor speech honoring President Jimmy Carter, highlighting Carter's Georgia roots, community engagement, and humanitarian work (including Habitat for Humanity), demonstrating bipartisan respect, emphasis on local heritage, and appreciation for civic volunteerism. Recently demonstrated bipartisan cooperation by leading a 221-198 bipartisan majority (including 11 Democrats) to pass H.J. Res. 20 to repeal an executive regulation that threatened jobs in his district, hosted Secretary of Energy Chris Wright at the Rinnai plant to celebrate the repeal, and used district Cabinet visits to spotlight local initiatives and constituent impacts—underscoring a pattern of leveraging federal relationships to protect local jobs and deliver tangible results for constituents. Continues to align closely with the Trump Administration's economic agenda—championing the Working Families Tax Cut and high-profile deregulation efforts alongside the Vice President and Cabinet officials—and emphasizes prioritizing American workers and domestic manufacturing. His Muhammad Ali American Boxing Revival Act further underscores a bipartisan, pro-worker, pro-community stance by seeking to revive an American sport, increase U.S.-based events, improve athlete protections and pay, and secure endorsements from major arena operators and business stakeholders. The December 2025 announcement that Mike Tyson endorsed MAABRA adds a high-profile athlete endorsement and emphasizes the bill's focus on fighter choice, closing promoter loopholes, and restoring balance for athletes. On January 3, 2025 he was sworn into the 119th Congress by Speaker Mike Johnson and publicly stated that voters gave President Trump and the 119th Congress a clear mandate to enact an 'America First'
