[{"bioguideId":"C001136","summary":"Introduced the Funding Small Businesses During Shutdowns Act to ensure continuation of key Small Business Administration (SBA) programs for a 30-day period during a government shutdown, providing targeted funding to maintain loan programs (including 7(a), Microloan, and SBIC) so small businesses can access capital, avoid disruption, and preserve local economic stability; criticized Republicans for risking shutdowns that harm the economy. Also introduced the SBIR Website Improvement Act to improve the SBIR and STTR award database (SBIR.gov) — making it searchable by research institutions, identifying Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), and adding data/search functions for Phase III projects — to increase transparency, help small businesses find R&D partners, and support commercialization of federally funded innovation. Led a letter urging the Secretary of Transportation to invoke existing authority to allocate $36 million from the FAA Facilities & Equipment account to upgrade the Philadelphia TRACON STARS system, arguing targeted FAA funding is needed to address communication and radar outages and maintain safe, reliable airport operations. Publicly criticized the Republican budget reconciliation process and proposed cuts that would reduce Medicaid and SNAP access, arguing that committee actions to cut essential programs to fund tax breaks for billionaires would harm veterans and other vulnerable Americans and that he will fight to protect those benefits. Secured $12,755,000 in community project (earmark) funding for New Jersey's 3rd District for local infrastructure, water and stormwater projects, public-safety facility upgrades, park and recreation improvements, library and community learning space upgrades, and a hospital cardiac lab enhancement — framing these investments as targeted federal spending to grow the local economy and meet community needs. Recently appointed to the House Small Business Committee, a role he says will allow him to more directly advocate for SBA policies, access to capital, and economic development priorities that affect the district's roughly 13,000 small businesses. Announced a senior staff team that includes Keith Roachford, a longtime Senate staffer with responsibility for Appropriations and Budget matters, signaling the office will be staffed with experienced personnel to manage appropriations, budget, defense, and economic development priorities for the district. At a February 2025 town hall, he reiterated strong opposition to cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP that he said are being advanced to pay for \"an enormous tax break to the wealthiest,\" vowing to fight those proposals and calling for bipartisan solutions that protect middle-class families. Urged a prompt court ruling in the Gateway Development Commission lawsuit to release federal grant and loan funds for the Hudson Tunnel Project, calling the project essential to the safety, reliability, and economic strength of the Northeast Corridor and warning that prolonged uncertainty threatens commuters, workers, and businesses. In a March 4, 2025 statement responding to the President's joint address, he criticized the Administration's policies as harmful to middle-class families, urged Republicans to work to support the middle class, and reiterated a commitment to pursue policies that strengthen economic security for families and children. Upon being sworn in to the 119th Congress, he pledged to \"uplift our economy\" and to work to ensure working families in his district and across the country can thrive, signaling continued emphasis on economic policies that benefit households and local communities.

criticized the Biden administration's 'burdensome economics' and expressed support for President Trump, pledging to work with and support Trump's economic policies to improve Americans' lives. At a series of town halls he discussed and promoted President Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill,' signaling continued alignment with Trump's economic agenda. In a March 2025 press release he applauded President Trump's Joint Address, calling Trump a 'visionary' and crediting his leadership with 'restoring our economy' and renewing the American Dream for families and Americans nationwide. In June 2025 he introduced the OCED Elimination Act, arguing the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations squandered billions and constituted wasteful government spending, and supported eliminating OCED funding as part of reducing waste and restoring economic accountability. In February 2026 he led passage of H.J.Res.142 to block the D.C. Council's effort to decouple local law from the Working Families Tax Cut Act, arguing he was protecting Trump-era tax relief (including no tax on tips and overtime, an increased standard deduction, and business expensing) to preserve service workers' and small businesses' take-home pay. In November 2025 he introduced the Congressional Budget Office Scheduling Reform Act to amend the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, requiring the CBO to publish a formalized calendar of major recurring reports (including baselines, deficit-reduction options, fiscal-year accuracy reports, and unauthorized appropriations reports) to increase transparency and ensure lawmakers have timely access to budgetary information; the proposal was supported by groups such as the National Taxpayers Union and the Economic Policy Innovation Center. In March 2025 he also called for immediately ending federal funding for NPR and PBS, arguing taxpayer dollars should not support what he described as partisan 'left-wing propaganda' and urging use of reconciliation and other budget tools to cut public broadcasting subsidies as an element of reducing wasteful federal spending. In April 2025 he publicly celebrated corporate investments tied to the Trump economic agenda—citing Abbott Laboratories' $500 million investment, Paris Baguette's $160 million facility, and LGM Pharma's $6 million expansion in Texas—as evidence Trump-era policies are delivering jobs and investment; he is working through budget reconciliation to enact and lock in those policies. In March 2025 he introduced legislation directing the United States Postal Service to assign a unique ZIP code to Northlake, Texas, arguing the change would reduce mailing and boundary confusion and protect the town's sales tax revenue by ensuring proper allocation of local tax receipts. In June 2025 he introduced the New IDEA Act to close what he describes as a tax-deduction loophole that allows employers to deduct wages and benefits paid to unauthorized workers; the bill would mandate IRS-DHS-SSA data-sharing to identify unauthorized workers, close tax incentives for hiring them, and strengthen and permanently authorize E-Verify to reduce the financial advantage for employers who hire illegal aliens. He was also selected to serve on the House Oversight D.O.G.E. (Delivering on Government Efficiency) Subcommittee, emphasizing plans to 'drain the swamp,' slash 'woke, weaponized government waste,' and use oversight to make federal spending and agencies more efficient, transparent, and accountable. In an October 1, 2025 statement he blamed Senate Democrats for a government shutdown, saying House Republicans had passed a 'clean' bipartisan continuing resolution and accusing Democrats of holding the government hostage by demanding funding priorities—including taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal immigrants—that he opposes. Upon being sworn in for the 119th Congress (January 3, 2025) Gill reiterated a campaign pledge to 'cut taxes and regulations' as an immediate priority aligned with President Trump's economic agenda. In July 2025 he voted to pass President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill, a package that pairs record border and deportation spending (including funding for a border wall and expanded deportations) with historic tax cuts for working-class families, signaling his willingness to back large enforcement appropriations alongside tax relief measures as part of the Trump economic agenda. In November 2025 he voted to reopen the government after a 43-day shutdown, reiterated that House Republicans had passed a 'clean' continuing resolution, blamed Senate Democrats for causing the lapse, and stressed the need to resume fiscal operations to avoid further harm to families and the economy. On February 26, 2025 he voted for a House budget resolution to extend President Trump's tax cuts, support roughly $1.5 trillion in spending reductions, and advance the 'One Big Beautiful Bill,' praising the resolution as the first step in the budget process to implement the Trump economic agenda. On March 11, 2025 Gill voted yes on a House continuing resolution to freeze current spending levels, avoid a government shutdown, and allow Republicans to prioritize President Trump's reconciliation bill; he described the CR as enabling spending cuts, empowering DOGE to carry out efficiency measures, and preserving funding to support the administration's deportation and border-enforcement priorities. In February 2025 he introduced legislation to abolish the Fogarty International Center, characterizing the center as duplicative of other NIH efforts, 'woke' and wasteful, criticizing its partnerships with the WHO and framing its elimination as an easy $95 million taxpayer saving as part of his DOGE-driven agenda to cut wasteful federal programs. In June 2025 he introduced the Mobilizing Against Sanctuary Cities Act to block federal financial assistance for one year to jurisdictions that refuse to honor ICE detainers or restrict communication

and voted for H.R.1 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' described in his office as delivering the largest tax cut in American history; backs using budget reconciliation to pass major fiscal changes, eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse from federal programs, and reallocating funds for priorities such as a border wall and missile defense. Praised the bill as a means to 'unleash our economy' and cited specific tax priorities included in the package (No Taxes on Tips, No Taxes on Overtime, and Historic Tax Relief for senior citizens). Also emphasized reducing improper payments and fraud as major budget priorities, highlighting the $2.7 trillion in taxpayer dollars lost to fraudulent and improper payments since 2003 and supporting oversight efforts through the Delivering on Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) Subcommittee to stamp out wasteful spending and streamline federal operations. Additionally introduced a bipartisan resolution honoring Delta Air Lines' 100th anniversary, highlighting Delta's role in creating jobs, driving business growth and infrastructure investment in Georgia, and helping keep the U.S. economy strong through global connectivity. Recently led passage of H.J. Res. 20 using the Congressional Review Act to repeal a Biden-era regulation that would have banned non-condensing tankless water heaters made at Rinnai's Griffin, GA facility—framing the action as preventing job losses, avoiding increased costs to consumers, and preserving choices in energy-efficient products.
