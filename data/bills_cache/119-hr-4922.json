  "summary": "<p><strong>DC Criminal Reforms to Immediately Make Everyone Safe Act or the DC CRIMES Act</strong></p><p>This bill limits the authority of the District of Columbia (DC) government over its criminal sentencing laws.&nbsp;</p><p>The bill eliminates the DC government’s authority to enact any act, resolution, or rule to change any criminal liability sentence in effect on the date of the bill's enactment.</p><p>The bill also (1) reduces the maximum age of a youth offender from 24 years to 18 years, and (2) repeals a provision that allows a DC criminal court to issue a sentence to a youth offender that is less than the mandatory minimum term otherwise required by law. A DC criminal court currently has the discretion to reduce or modify certain criminal sentences for a youth offender under specified circumstances. For example, a DC court may sentence a youth offender to probation in lieu of confinement. (However, this discretion does not apply to several specified violent crimes.)&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, the bill directs the Office of the Attorney General for DC to publish, and update monthly, certain youth offender crime data on a publicly accessible website.&nbsp;</p>",
