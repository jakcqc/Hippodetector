  "title": "A joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Bureau of Land Management relating to \"National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska Integrated Activity Plan Record of Decision\".",
  "summary": "<p>This joint resolution nullifies the rule submitted by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) titled <em>National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska Integrated Activity Plan Record of Decision&nbsp;</em>and issued on April 25, 2022. BLM's plan provides for the management of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, which is an approximately 23-million-acre area on Alaska’s North Slope. The&nbsp;2022 plan replaced the 2020 plan and closed approximately 48% of the reserve to oil and gas leasing&nbsp;in order to protect certain surface resources and uses, such as protecting wildlife and providing subsistence&nbsp;for communities. Thus, the joint resolution removes the protections provided under the 2022 plan and reverts to the 2020 plan.</p>",
