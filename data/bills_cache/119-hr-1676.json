  "summary": "<p><strong>Make SWAPs Efficient Act of 2025 or the Make State Wildlife Action Plans Efficient Act of 2025</strong></p><p>This bill modifies the State Wildlife Grant Program (SWGP) to establish a deadline for the Department of the Interior to approve state wildlife conservation and restoration programs. Under the SWGP, Interior provides funding to state wildlife agencies to implement their comprehensive plans (commonly known as state wildlife action plans or&nbsp;SWAPs) for state wildlife conservation and restoration programs.</p><p>The bill directs Interior to approve a state wildlife conservation and restoration program within 180 days after the date on which the state submitted its SWAP if Interior finds that the SWAP complies with the requirements of the SWGP. If Interior misses the deadline, the bill requires (1) the SWAP to be automatically approved, and (2) Interior to set aside amounts under the&nbsp;Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Account for the state.</p>",
