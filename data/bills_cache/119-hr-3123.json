Specifically, if the VA issues a decision awarding entitlement to a pension to a veteran prior to the veteran’s death but issues the payment after the veteran dies, the pension must be paid to the first available recipient on the following list:&nbsp;(1) the veteran’s living spouse; (2) the veteran’s living children; (3) the veteran’s living dependent parents; or (4) the estate of the veteran, unless the estate will escheat&nbsp;(i.e., transfer to the state).&nbsp;To be eligible for such pension payments, a claimant of accrued benefits must file an application within one year after the veteran's death.</p><p>If no application for accrued benefits is filed within one year following the death of the veteran, the pension must be paid to the veteran’s estate unless the estate will escheat.</p>",
