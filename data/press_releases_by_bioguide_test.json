He also highlighted how President Trump and Congressional Republicans are working to make housing more affordable by removing barriers for building homes and delivering historic tax relief for working families. Click here to watch Rep. Burlison's opening remarks. Below are Subcommittee Chairman Burlison’s remarks as prepared for delivery: Let’s start with a basic reality check. A young American can work full-time, do everything right, and still have no realistic path to owning a home. Not because they are lazy. Not because they made reckless choices. But because public policy has made ownership more expensive and further out of reach than it has been in decades. Only twenty-five percent of Americans say they are confident they can afford to buy a home. More than half say they have little or no confidence at all. Housing affordability is now at a forty-year low. At the same time, Americans are seeing something that doesn’t add up. Across the country, people who entered the United States illegally are living in housing that many working Americans cannot afford. That is not a talking point. It is a policy outcome. Young adults who followed the law, entered the workforce, and tried to build a future are told they should accept permanent renting. Meanwhile, government programs increase housing demand, subsidize select populations, and drive prices higher for everyone else. That is not fairness. That is displacement. Nearly one-quarter of homeowners and almost half of renters spend at least thirty percent of their income on housing. For millions of families, housing is no longer a foundation for stability—it is a financial choke point. So how did we get here? First, the Federal Reserve held interest rates near zero and injected trillions of dollars into the economy leading up to and during the COVID pandemic. Mortgage rates fell sharply. Demand surged. Home prices skyrocketed while housing supply failed to keep pace. Then the Federal Reserve reversed course. Interest rates climbed to their highest levels since 2008. Americans were left with the worst possible combination: elevated home prices and sharply higher borrowing costs. At the same time, the Biden administration fueled historic inflation through excessive federal spending. Paychecks lost purchasing power, while housing costs continued to rise. Now consider supply. The United States is short somewhere between 3.8 and 8.2 million homes today. By 2035, that shortage could approach 10 million units. Instead of prioritizing supply, federal policy increased demand. Mass illegal immigration placed immediate pressure on housing markets across the country—especially in working-class communities. More people competing for too few homes drove rents and prices higher for Americans already struggling to get ahead. Washington also made housing more expensive to build. Federal regulations on building codes, energy standards, and home appliances added tens of thousands of dollars to the cost of constructing or renovating a home. Proposals for nationwide rent control further discouraged new construction and reduced supply. The result is a system that squeezes working Americans from every direction. Higher prices. Higher interest rates. Too little supply. And demand competition driven by federal policy. That is not a failure of the free market. It is a failure of government. President Trump and Congressional Republicans are taking a different approach. On day one, the President directed his Cabinet to deliver emergency price relief by expanding housing supply and eliminating regulations that raise costs. The Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of the Interior are working to make federal land available for housing development. Congress passed H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill, which delivered historic tax relief for working families and removed barriers that make it harder to build new homes. The direction is clear. Housing affordability will not be restored by trapping Americans in permanent rent. It will not be restored by distorting markets or importing demand into an already broken system. It will be restored by unleashing American builders, dismantling the regulatory cartel, mass deportations, and putting HARD-WORKING American families back at the center of national policy—where they belong. That is why we are here today."

Homeowners reported being ordered to remove structures that had existed for decades, including cases that were supported by historical documentation and satellite imagery.</p><p><strong>Congressman Burlison</strong> raised these concerns repeatedly with Corps leadership and senior Army officials in multiple meetings. Despite these efforts, enforcement pressures persisted at the district level, including actions related to dock-lease renewals.</p><p>Recent administrative steps by the Trump administration, including leadership changes within the Little Rock District and direct engagement by senior Army Corps civilian leadership, mark a significant turning point toward resolving the issue and aligning enforcement practices with congressional intent.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.swl.usace.army.mil/Media/News-Releases/Article/4380523/telle-graham-announce-leadership-change-at-usace-little-rock-district/\" data-entity-type=\"external\">announcing</a> the leadership change, Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works <strong>Adam Telle</strong> cited entrenched bureaucratic practices that have frustrated the public.</p><p>“<em>We have incredible, patriotic people serving in our Corps of Engineers Districts throughout the nation, including in Little Rock, but we also have entrenched bureaucracies that have unnecessarily frustrated American citizens. For the first time in decades, under the Trump Administration, Commanders who fail to follow orders and overcome entrenched bureaucracy will be dealt with accordingly,</em>” said <strong>Telle</strong>.</p><p>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Commanding General <strong>William \"Butch\" Graham</strong> confirmed that the Little Rock District commander had been relieved of duty, underscoring expectations for leadership and accountability across the agency.</p><p>“<em>Today, I made the decision to relieve the USACE Little Rock District commander based on a loss of confidence in his ability to command. This decision was made in the best interest of the District and the American public whom we proudly serve. District commanders across USACE are expected to demonstrate effective leadership committed to rapid and continuous transformation, less red tape, and a bias for action. Our highest priority remains efficiently delivering vital projects for the American people on-time and within budget, and this change reinforces our steadfast commitment,</em>” said <strong>Graham</strong>.</p><p>“<em>The Trump administration is taking proactive, decisive steps to ensure that these unreasonable interpretations come to an end,” </em>said <strong>Congressman Burlison</strong>.<em> “I have worked tirelessly with all parties involved to reach a commonsense outcome that respects congressional intent, protects property owners, and brings long-overdue clarity for families at Table Rock Lake.

          "bodyText": "Washington, D.C. — Congressman Eric Burlison (MO-07) and Senator Eric Schmitt (MO) today welcomed the decisive action by the Trump administration to address long-standing enforcement issues by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at Table Rock Lake and to restore clarity for Missouri property owners. Following the enactment of the Water Resources Development Act in January 2025, residents around Table Rock Lake continued to face enforcement actions based on a narrow interpretation of the law by the Corps’ Little Rock District despite clear congressional intent to protect long-standing, good-faith property uses. Homeowners reported being ordered to remove structures that had existed for decades, including cases that were supported by historical documentation and satellite imagery. Congressman Burlison raised these concerns repeatedly with Corps leadership and senior Army officials in multiple meetings. Despite these efforts, enforcement pressures persisted at the district level, including actions related to dock-lease renewals. Recent administrative steps by the Trump administration, including leadership changes within the Little Rock District and direct engagement by senior Army Corps civilian leadership, mark a significant turning point toward resolving the issue and aligning enforcement practices with congressional intent. In announcing the leadership change, Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Adam Telle cited entrenched bureaucratic practices that have frustrated the public. “ We have incredible, patriotic people serving in our Corps of Engineers Districts throughout the nation, including in Little Rock, but we also have entrenched bureaucracies that have unnecessarily frustrated American citizens. For the first time in decades, under the Trump Administration, Commanders who fail to follow orders and overcome entrenched bureaucracy will be dealt with accordingly, ” said Telle . U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Commanding General William \"Butch\" Graham confirmed that the Little Rock District commander had been relieved of duty, underscoring expectations for leadership and accountability across the agency. “ Today, I made the decision to relieve the USACE Little Rock District commander based on a loss of confidence in his ability to command. This decision was made in the best interest of the District and the American public whom we proudly serve. District commanders across USACE are expected to demonstrate effective leadership committed to rapid and continuous transformation, less red tape, and a bias for action. Our highest priority remains efficiently delivering vital projects for the American people on-time and within budget, and this change reinforces our steadfast commitment, ” said Graham . “ The Trump administration is taking proactive, decisive steps to ensure that these unreasonable interpretations come to an end,” said Congressman Burlison . “I have worked tirelessly with all parties involved to reach a commonsense outcome that respects congressional intent, protects property owners, and brings long-overdue clarity for families at Table Rock Lake. I’m especially grateful to Assistant Secretary Adam Telle for taking this issue seriously and helping move things in the right direction. I also want to thank Senator Schmitt for being a strong partner in this bicameral effort. It finally feels like we are on a clear path toward a durable solution. ” Senator Schmitt emphasized the broader need to confront entrenched bureaucratic practices within federal agencies. “ For too long, the Army Corps of Engineers has faced a significant battle against unshaken bureaucracies among their district offices. In my home state of Missouri, residents of Table Rock Lake know this story far too well,” said Senator Schmitt . “I applaud the Trump administration, and especially Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Adam Telle, for taking decisive action to break up these decades-old, entrenched bureaucracies in their district offices.
