      "title": "An act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to title II of H. Con. Res. 14.",
      "summary": "<p><strong>One Big Beautiful Bill Act</strong></p><p>This bill reduces taxes, reduces or increases spending for various federal programs, increases the statutory debt limit, and otherwise addresses agencies and programs throughout the federal government. &nbsp;</p><p>It is known as a reconciliation bill and includes legislation submitted by 11 House committees pursuant to provisions in the FY2025 congressional budget resolution (H Con. Res. 14) that directed the committees to submit legislation to the House Budget Committee that will increase or decrease the deficit and increase the statutory debt limit by specified amounts. (Reconciliation bills are considered by Congress using expedited legislative procedures that prevent a filibuster and restrict amendments in the Senate.)</p><p>TITLE I--COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE&nbsp;</p><p>This title addresses a wide range of Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs, including by changing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and extending programs authorized by the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (commonly known as the 2018 farm bill).</p><p>Subtitle A--Nutrition</p><p>(Sec. 10001) This section prohibits USDA from increasing the cost of the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) based on a reevaluation or update of the contents of the TFP (i.e., the market basket of goods). Further, any annual adjustment to the cost of the plan must be based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.</p><p>As background, USDA created the&nbsp;TFP (the cost of purchasing a nutritionally adequate low-cost diet), which is used to determine maximum monthly benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). USDA calculates the cost of the TFP each year to account for food price inflation. Maximum allotments are set at the monthly cost of the TFP for a four-person family, adjusted for family size. Under a provision of the 2018 farm bill, USDA must reevaluate the market basket of goods every five years based on current food prices, food composition data, consumption patterns, and dietary guidance.&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 10002) This section expands the applicability of work requirements for SNAP recipients who are able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs). As background, these SNAP recipients have work-related requirements in addition to the general SNAP work registration and employment and training requirements.</p><p>Specifically, the section amends the exemptions to this requirement.</p><p>First, the section applies the work requirements for&nbsp;ABAWDs to adults who are not over 65 years old, whereas these requirements currently apply to adults who are not over 55 years old.</p><p>Second, the&nbsp;ABAWD exemption for a parent or household member with responsibility for a dependent child is restricted to a dependent child under the age of seven. Currently, the child must be under the age of 18.&nbsp;</p><p>This section includes an exception for a person who is (1) responsible for a dependent child who is seven years of age or older, and (2) married to and resides with an individual who complies with the SNAP work requirements.</p><p>In addition, the section specifies that current&nbsp;ABAWD exemptions set to sunset on October 1, 2030 will sunset. These exemptions from the ABAWD work requirements are for homeless individuals, veterans, and certain foster care individuals (those who are 24 years old or younger and were in foster care on the date of attaining 18 years of age or a higher age).</p><p>(Sec. 10003) This section modifies the&nbsp;ABAWD waiver program's&nbsp;allowable state exemptions. Under current law, an&nbsp;ABAWD waiver program allows state exemptions based on an area having an unemployment rate of over 10% or an insufficient number of jobs. The section amends the exemption to require the unemployment rate to be based on the rate for the county, instead of the area. Further, the section repeals the provision that allows a state exemption if that area does not have a sufficient number of jobs.</p><p>Under current law, a state agency may exempt up to 8% of SNAP recipients from the&nbsp;ABAWD work requirements for each fiscal year. This section reduces the percentage of exemptions a state agency may provide each year so that the average monthly number of exemptions does not exceed 1% of covered individuals (i.e., SNAP recipients and certain individuals who were denied SNAP benefits due to the work requirements).&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 10004) This section limits the availability of the Standard Utility Allowance (SUA) for determining SNAP income eligibility. Specifically, only households that include an elderly or disabled member may be considered automatically eligible for the SUA based on participation in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) or a similar energy assistance program.&nbsp;</p><p>As background, when determining a household’s eligibility for SNAP, states consider the total shelter costs for a household, including the cost of utilities. States can use&nbsp;SUAs, which are standard amounts that represent low-income household utility costs in the state or local area. Currently, all LIHEAP participants who receive a minimum benefit are eligible for the SUA for determining SNAP income eligibility.</p><p>(Sec. 10005) This section prohibits household&nbsp;internet costs (e.g., monthly subscriber fees) from being used in computing the excess shelter expense deduction for the purposes of determining the size of household SNAP benefits.</p><p>(Sec. 10006) This section establishes state-matching fund requirements for the cost of SNAP program allotments. Currently, the state match is 0%. Beginning in FY2028, any state that has a payment error rate that is less than 6% must contribute a 5% match for the cost of SNAP program allotments.&nbsp;</p><p>A state with a payment error rate that is</p><ul><li>at least 6% but less than 8% must contribute 15%;</li><li>at least 8% but less than 10% must contribute 20%; and</li><li>10% or greater must contribute 25%.</li></ul><p>(Sec. 10007) This section reduces the amount that USDA may pay a state agency for administrative costs for the operation of SNAP to 25% of all administrative costs, from the current 50%, thereby increasing the state share of administrative costs from 50% to 75%.</p><p>(Sec. 10008) This section modifies the general work requirements of the SNAP program to cover individuals who are over the age of 17 and under the age of 65. Currently, the general work requirements apply to individuals who are over the age of 15 and under the age of 60. It also exempts parents or members of a household with responsibility for the care of a child who is under the age of seven (under the age of six under current law) from the requirements.&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 10009) This section requires state agencies (under the SNAP National Accuracy Clearinghouse) to use each indication of a multiple issuance of SNAP benefits to prevent multiple issuances of other federal and state assistance program benefits.</p><p>(Sec. 10010) This section reduces the tolerance level to $0 for a state to exclude small SNAP payment errors in the calculation of payment error rates.&nbsp;</p><p>As background, the SNAP quality control system measures how accurately SNAP state agencies determine a household’s eligibility and benefit amount and determines overpayments of benefits and underpayments. Under current law, the Food and Nutrition Service must set a tolerance level for excluding small payment errors in the calculation of payment error rates (e.g., $56 or less in FY2024). This section requires that the calculation of payment error rates include all SNAP payment errors.</p><p>(Sec. 10011) This section eliminates the SNAP Nutrition Education and Obesity Prevention Grant Program (SNAP-ED).</p><p>(Sec. 10012) This section limits SNAP benefits to individuals who reside in the United States and are (1) a citizen, or (2) an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence as an immigrant, with exceptions. Currently, SNAP eligibility extends to additional individuals who are classified as an alien under federal law, including an alien who has qualified for conditional entry under the asylum and refugee laws.</p><p>This section also extends funding for the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) through FY2031. TEFAP provides food commodities (and cash support for storage and distribution costs) through states to local emergency feeding organizations (e.g., food banks).</p><p>Subtitle B--Investment in Rural America</p><p>(Sec. 10101) This section amends and extends commodity support programs.</p><p>For example, the section extends the Price Loss Coverage Program, the Agricultural Risk Coverage Program, and Dairy Margin Coverage through crop year 2031. It also modifies various requirements for the programs.</p><p>The section also extends the suspension of permanent price authority through crop year 2031 for commodities other than dairy and through December 31, 2031, for dairy.</p><p>Further, the section addresses programs and issues such as marketing loans, disaster assistance, the sugar program, federal crop insurance, the Livestock Indemnity Program, and the establishment of a Poultry Insurance Pilot Program.</p><p>For example, this section provides for a number of changes to Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC), which include</p><ul><li>changing the definition of production history to remove the consideration of production at the time the dairy operation first registered to participate in the DMC program;</li><li>setting production history for the DMC program as the highest annual milk marketings for participating dairies during calendar year 2021, 2022, or 2023;</li><li>raising the coverage limit to the first six million pounds for both Tier I and Tier II premiums, from the first five million pounds; and</li><li>allowing producers to receive a 25% premium discount for a one-time premium election covering calendar years 2026-2031.</li></ul><p>(Sec. 10102) This section&nbsp;reauthorizes, and extends funding for, the following programs through FY2031:</p><ul><li>the Grassroots Source Water Protection Program,</li><li>the Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive Program,</li><li>the Feral Swine Eradication and Control Pilot Program,</li><li>the Agriculture Conservation Easement Program (ACEP),</li><li>the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP),</li><li>the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP),</li><li>the Rural Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP), and</li><li>the Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations Program.</li></ul><p>This section also rescinds the&nbsp;unobligated funds that were provided for ACEP, EQIP, CSP, and RCPP conservation programs as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 10103) This section extends and provides increased funding for agricultural trade promotion and facilitation through FY2031. Specified funds are provided for the Market Access Program, Foreign Market Development Program, &nbsp;E (Kika) de la Garza Emerging Marketing Program, Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops program, and the Priority Trade Fund.</p><p>(Sec. 10104) This section&nbsp;reauthorizes and provides funding for a number of USDA research initiatives.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, this section provides specified funds to the 1890 National Scholars Program for FY2026 for student scholarships. This National Institute of Food and Agriculture program provides grants to 1890 Institutions (i.e., historically Black colleges and universities that belong to the U.S. land-grant university system) for students who intend to pursue a career in the food and agricultural sciences.</p><p>This section provides the Specialty Crop Research Initiative with $175 million in mandatory funding for FY2026. Currently, the program is funded at $80 million for each fiscal year.</p><p>This section also provides funding for competitive grants to assist in the construction, alteration, acquisition, modernization, renovation, or remodeling of Agricultural Research Facilities.</p><p>(Sec. 10105) This section extends and modifies the Secure Rural Schools (SRS) program.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the existing&nbsp;SRS program, states and counties containing federal land may receive payments from the U.S. Forest Service or the Department of the Interior respectively. This section extends the authority of the Forest Service and Interior to (1) calculate and provide payments to states and counties under the SRS program through FY2026, and (2) initiate projects using funds provided by the program through FY2028. It also extends the deadline to obligate those funds until the end of FY2029.</p><p>This section rescinds specified&nbsp;unobligated funds that were provided by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 for (1) competitive grants to nonfederal forest landowners, and (2) state and private forestry conservation programs.&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 10106) This section&nbsp;reauthorizes, and extends funding for, the biobased markets program (i.e., BioPreferred Program) through FY2031 to promote biobased products through (1) mandatory purchasing requirements for federal agencies and their contractors, and (2) a voluntary labeling initiative for biobased products.</p><p>This section&nbsp;reauthorizes, and extends funding for, the bioenergy program for advanced biofuels (i.e., Advanced Biofuel Payment Program) through FY2031. The program provides payments to fuel producers to support and expand production of advanced biofuels (i.e., not derived from corn starch).</p><p>(Sec. 10107) This section provides additional funding for the Plant Pest and Disease Management Disaster Prevention Program for FY2026 and each fiscal year thereafter.</p><p>This section provides additional funding for the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program for FY2026 and each fiscal year thereafter. Under the block grant program, USDA provides grants to the state departments of agriculture to enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops (i.e., fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, horticulture, and nursery crops, including floriculture).</p><p>The section also&nbsp;reauthorizes, and extends funding for, organic production and market data initiatives through FY2031.&nbsp;</p><p>This section&nbsp;reauthorizes, and extends funding through FY2026, for USDA to carry out the modernization and improvement of international trade technology systems and data collection on imports of organically produced agricultural products accepted into the United States.</p><p>The section also&nbsp;reauthorizes the Organic Certification Cost Share Program, which provides cost share assistance to producers and handlers of agricultural products who are obtaining or renewing their certification under the National Organic Program.</p><p>This section&nbsp;reauthorizes, and extends funding through FY2026 for the multiple crop and pesticide use survey of farmers. The USDA Office of Pest Management Policy conducts this survey to collect data for risk assessment modeling and mitigation for an active ingredient.</p><p>(Sec. 10108) This section increases funding for the National Animal Health Laboratory Network. Specific increases in funding are also provided for the National Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Program and the National Animal Vaccine and Veterinary Countermeasures Bank.</p><p>This section extends and increases funding for the Sheep Production &amp; Marketing Grant Program through FY2026. This program seeks to strengthen and enhance the production and marketing of sheep and sheep products in the United States.</p><p>This section also extends the</p><ul><li>Pima Agriculture Cotton Trust Fund through December 31, 2031, which provides assistance to reduce the economic injury to domestic manufacturers resulting from tariffs on cotton fabric that are higher than tariffs on certain apparel articles made of cotton fabric;</li><li>Agriculture Wool Apparel Manufacturers Trust Fund through December 31, 2031, which provides assistance to reduce the economic injury to domestic manufacturers resulting from tariffs on wool fabric that are higher than tariffs on certain apparel articles made of wool fabric;</li><li>Wool Research and Promotion Program through FY2031, which provides grants to assist U.S. wool producers with improving the quality of wool and with developing and promoting the wool market; and</li><li>Emergency Citrus Disease Research and Development Trust Fund through FY2031, which funds a program that aims to bring together scientists to find scientifically sound and financially sustainable solutions to Huanglongbing (i.e., citrus greening, a bacterial disease spread by an insect that feeds on citrus).</li></ul><p>TITLE II--COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES</p><p>(Sec. 20001) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to the Department of Defense (DOD) for</p><ul><li>the Marine Corps Barracks 2030 initiative,</li><li>the Defense Health Program,</li><li>supplemental payments of Basic Allowance for Housing to military personnel, and</li><li>tuition assistance and child care assistance for members of the Armed Forces.</li></ul><p>The section also provides statutory authority to extend from 14 to 21 days eligibility for Temporary Lodging Expense (TLE) for certain servicemembers undergoing a permanent change of station.</p><p>Additionally, the section temporarily increases authorized investment amounts and provides additional authorization for the acquisition or construction of certain military housing through private contracts.</p><p>(Sec. 20002) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for the shipbuilding industrial base and various naval shipbuilding activities.&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 20003) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for the development of (1) space-based missile intercept capabilities, (2) military space-based sensors, and (3) the continued development of ground-based missile defense systems and related infrastructure.</p><p>(Sec. 20004) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for various military weapon systems, including hypersonic, air-to-air, cruise, and anti-ship missiles.</p><p>(Sec. 20005) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to expand the small, unmanned aerial system (UAS) industrial base, to advance the use of artificial intelligence in these and other systems, and to support the integration of commercial developments in military technology.</p><p>The section also provides additional funding to finance loans and loan guarantees by the DOD Office of Strategic Capital.</p><p>(Sec. 20006) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to replace current business systems, deploy automation, and deploy artificial intelligence to accelerate audits of DOD financial statements.</p><p>(Sec. 20007) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to (1) modernize the capabilities of fighter, transport, and other military aircraft; (2) prevent the retirement of certain fighter aircraft (e.g., F-22); and (3) produce next-generation manned and unmanned aircraft.</p><p>(Sec. 20008) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for nuclear defense resources and nuclear forces development and production.</p><p>(Sec. 20009) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for (1) various military exercises and infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific region, (2) classified military space-superiority programs, and (3) military support to the government of Taiwan.</p><p>(Sec. 20010) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to enhance and modernize (1) military depots and shipyards, and (2) Special Operations Command (SOCOM) equipment.&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 20011) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to support border operations, including deployment of military personnel.</p><p>(Sec. 20012) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 to enhance military intelligence programs.</p><p>(Sec. 20013) This section provides additional funding for FY2025 for the DOD Office of Inspector General to monitor the activities for which funding is provided under this title.</p><p>(Sec. 20014) This section authorizes each military department to use funding under this title for military construction, land acquisition, and military family housing.

The section specifies eligibility for certain nationals of Cuba, Ukraine, or Afghanistan, and individuals who lawfully reside in the United States in accordance with a Compact of Free Association (i.e., the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of&nbsp;Palau).</p><p>(Sec. 30002) This section changes the way student eligibility for need-based federal aid is calculated by basing the calculation on the median cost of attendance by program of study from all institutions of higher education (IHEs) that offer such program of study rather than the cost of attendance of a student’s specific program as determined by their IHE.</p><p>The section also restores an exemption for certain family farms and small businesses on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form. This section applies to the net worth of (1) a family farm on which the family resides, or (2) a small business with not more than 100 full-time or full-time equivalent employees that is owned and controlled by the family.</p><p>Subtitle B--Loan Limits</p><p>This subtitle makes various changes to federal student loans.&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 30011) This section terminates the ability of undergraduate students to receive subsidized loans and terminates the ability of graduate or professional students to receive Direct PLUS Loans beginning on July 1, 2026. It provides an exception (of up to three academic years) for a student who is already enrolled in a program of study and received a loan for the program.&nbsp;</p><p>The section also places certain restrictions on Parent PLUS Loans. In particular, parents may only borrow a Parent Plus Loan if the dependent student has already taken out their maximum annual unsubsidized loan amount.&nbsp;</p><p>The section also establishes new annual and aggregate loan limits for borrowers. For example, the section sets an overall aggregate lifetime borrowing limit of $200,000 for any single borrower across all federal loan types.</p><p>The section allows&nbsp;IHEs to set lower loan limits.</p><p>Subtitle C--Loan Repayment</p><p>This subtitle revises loan repayment options for federal student loans.</p><p>(Sec. 30021) This section terminates all current student loan repayment plans for loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2026.</p><p>The Department of Education (ED) may only offer borrowers two options for repayment of federal student loans: a standard repayment plan (with the length of the repayment term determined by the total amount borrowed) and an income-based repayment plan (to be known as the Repayment Assistance Plan).</p><p>(Sec. 30022) This section eliminates economic hardship and unemployment deferments beginning on July 1, 2025. It also reduces the total period a borrower may be in forbearance.</p><p>A borrower who is serving in a medical or dental internship or residency program may be eligible for a forbearance in which no interest accrues for the first four 12-month intervals. However, interest begins to accrue for any subsequent 12-month interval.&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 30023) This section allows borrowers to rehabilitate a defaulted loan twice (currently, only once). However, beginning on July 1, 2025, the borrower must pay a minimum payment amount of $10.</p><p>(Sec. 30024) This section allows payments under the new Repayment Assistance Plan to count as qualifying payments for purposes of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program.</p><p>The section also specifies that a public service job, for purposes of the&nbsp;PSLF program, does not include time served in a medical or dental internship or residency program by an individual who, as of June 30, 2025, has not borrowed a Federal Direct PLUS Loan or a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan.&nbsp;</p><p>(Sec. 30025) This section provides FY2025 and FY2026 funding to ED for administrative costs.</p><p>Subtitle D--Pell Grants</p><p>This subtitle makes changes to&nbsp;Pell Grants.</p><p>(Sec. 30031) This section requires foreign income that is exempt from taxation or foreign income for which an individual receives a foreign tax credit to be included in the adjusted gross income calculation for purposes of calculating eligibility for&nbsp;Pell Grants.</p><p>Students with a student aid index that equals or exceeds twice the amount of the total maximum&nbsp;Pell Grant are ineligible for Pell Grants, regardless of their adjusted gross income.&nbsp;</p><p>The section also increases the number of credits needed to qualify for full-time enrollment in order to receive&nbsp;Pell Grants.</p><p>The section prohibits a student who is enrolled less than half time from receiving a&nbsp;Pell Grant.</p><p>The section’s changes take effect beginning on July 1, 2025.</p><p>(Sec. 30032) This section requires ED to award Workforce&nbsp;Pell Grants to students enrolled in eligible workforce programs. Eligible programs are those that provide at least 150 clock hours (but less than 600 clock hours) of instruction during a minimum of 8 weeks (but less than 15 weeks).</p><p>The section’s changes take effect beginning on July 1, 2026.</p><p>(Sec. 30033) This section increases funding for&nbsp;Pell Grants for FY2026-FY2028.</p><p>Subtitle E--Accountability</p><p>This subtitle creates a new risk-sharing framework for&nbsp;IHEs.</p><p>(Sec. 30041) This section requires&nbsp;IHEs participating in federal student loan programs to make annual risk-sharing payments based on the nonrepayment balance of student loan cohorts.&nbsp;</p><p>The section also outlines penalties for late or missing payments. For example, the section prohibits an&nbsp;IHE from offering Direct Loans to students if the IHE has not made a payment within 12 months of receiving a notification from ED. The section also prohibits an IHE from offering Direct Loans or awarding Pell Grants if the IHE has not made a risk-sharing payment in 18 months.

McCray</em>, a 2018 case decided by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York. In that case, the court held that butyryl fentanyl, a controlled substance, can be considered an analogue of fentanyl even though, under the Controlled Substances Act, the term <em>controlled substance analogue</em> specifically excludes a controlled substance.</p>",
